# Embedded Sprint – Day 12 (Aug 22) Overview

## Summary
Solve C and embedded firmware puzzles typical of technical interviews to strengthen foundational skills.

## Topics

- **Bitwise operations and manipulation**
- **Memory-mapped register access**
- **Finite state machines in C**

## Tasks
- Select 10–15 embedded C interview questions
- Implement solutions with test harnesses
- Optimize for performance and readability
- Document trade-offs

## Deliverables
### Interview problems code
Directory with solutions and test harness. Include Makefile and verification.

### Study notes
Markdown summarising pointer aliasing, volatile, static vs global, bit shifts.

### Self-reflection
Identify difficult problems and plan follow-up study.
