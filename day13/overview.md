# Embedded Sprint – Day 13 (Aug 23) Overview

## Summary
Practice system design problems and implement low-power techniques for embedded applications.

## Topics
- **Low-power modes and wakeup sources**
- **Signal conditioning and filtering**
- **Real-time scheduling and jitter**
- **Memory/performance trade-offs**

## Tasks
- Solve system design interview questions
- Implement low-power sleep/stop modes
- Optimise firmware with DMA and minimal ISR work
- Measure theoretical power savings

## Deliverables
### System design write-ups
Half-page write-ups with block diagrams for two design questions.

### Low-power demo
Firmware entering sleep/stop and waking on interrupt. Document register changes.

### Optimisation report
Document three optimisations and their impact on latency or power.
